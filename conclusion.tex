\section{Conclusion}
This paper introduces the block signal recovery problem, which aims to detect $M$'s block structure through linear measurements. A matrix with block structure is neither low rank nor sparse so shrinkage estimators extensively studied in the literature is not directly applicable CITE. We develop a set of combinatorial techniques inspired by graph-based inference algorithms to tackle the problem. Our algorithm is sample-optimal and can be used to solve a high-dimensional regression problem $\my \sim M \mx + \varepsilon$. The algorithm has better asymptotic performance than shrinkage or variables selection methods. This algorithm also explains why existing clustering-based heuristics work. The probabilistic techniques we develop for analyzing correlated edges on $G$ is new for random graph analysis, and can be of independent interests.
